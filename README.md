# Pixels-to-Plate-AI-Recipe-Generation
Working on a research project that leverages computer vision, deep learning and NLP techniques for automatic recipe generation. Specifically, I'm using YOLOv5 for ingredient detection and large language models to generate context-aware recipes from visual input. The project integrates AI-driven insights to automate the recipe generation process.
